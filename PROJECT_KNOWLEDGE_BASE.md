# 🐈 SleepyCat SEO Platform: 360° Knowledge Base (v6.2)

## 1. Project Mission
To transform SleepyCat’s content strategy from "AI-assisted drafting" to a "Data-Driven, Multi-Agent SEO Factory." The platform generates 1000-1500 word AEO-optimized blog posts grounded in real-time competitor data and verified product specs (E-E-A-T).

---

## 2. Technical Architecture: The 5-Agent Pipeline
The system utilizes a sequential hand-off model:

1.  **🕵️ The SERP Spy (Agent 1):** Scrapes top 3 Google results + 150-char paragraph previews.
2.  **🐈 The Brand Strategist (Agent 2):** Produces a structured 6-section brief (Angle, Gaps, Tone, Product Pushes).
3.  **🧪 The Lab Tester / Drafter (Agent 3):** Writes a 1500-word draft following the Brand Final Formula. (Anti-Jargon enforced).
4.  **🏗️ The SEO Architect (Agent 4):** Optimizes for AEO. Adds 40-50 word bold snippets, comparison tables, and internal links. **Does not shorten.**
5.  **✍️ The Senior Editor / Humanizer (Agent 5):** Final pass for brand soul. Preserves all AEO/SEO structures.

## 6. Agent Prompt Specifications (v5.9 Claude Suggestions)

Each agent's system prompt is defined in `sleepycat_seo_agent.py`. This section documents the intended behaviour so future edits don't regress content quality.

### Agent 1 — SERP Spy
- Scrapes **3 URLs**, 3s timeout
- Extracts: H2/H3 headings (up to 6) + first 2 paragraph previews (150 chars each)
- Output: raw competitor structure passed to Strategist

### Agent 2 — Brand Strategist
- Produces a **structured strategy brief** with 6 sections: Article Angle, Target Reader, H2 Structure (5-6 headings), Key Product Pushes, Content Gaps, Tone Note
- Has full brand DNA + product DB in system prompt
- Temperature: 0.7 (creative angles needed)

### Agent 3 — Lab Tester / Drafter
- Writes **1000-1500 word full draft** following the Brand Final Formula
- Formula: Hook → 4-5 H2 sections → "Why SleepyCat?" section → CTA closing
- Anti-jargon enforced: no ILD/density/coil count — use feel/materials/support
- Temperature: 0.4 (factual but natural)
- Uses only verified specs from product_catalog.json

### Agent 4 — SEO Architect
- **Does NOT shorten the article** — common regression point
- Adds 40-50 word AEO snippet immediately after H1 (bold, direct answer)
- Adds/improves comparison table with: Mattress | Technology | Key Benefit | Firmness | Best For | Link
- Adds internal links: Ultima/Original/Ortho → sleepycat.in/products/{name}
- Temperature: 0.1 (precise, structural)

### Agent 5 — Senior Editor / Humanizer
- Receives full humanizer_rules.txt content as system prompt
- Must preserve ALL content — tables, links, AEO snippet, length (1000+ words)
- Temperature: 0.5
